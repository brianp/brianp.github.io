      <description>Coming from Ruby, JS, Python or another language? Exploring new languages can be toilsome. Rust is no different. You’ll find new idioms and features that could be unfamiliar to navigate. You might even detest them at first; comparing it to how you’d prefer it in your favourite language.
We will learn to navigate your transition into the Rust landscape. Introduce practices that might not make sense at first. See comparisons of how you may have done things, and how we can improve those practices with Rust.</description>

All Exercises
 Methods are function that accept self &amp;amp;self.items == &amp;amp;(self.items) where the borrow (&amp;amp;) is for the item, not for self. Structs have no default value, requires creating all values. mut as mute not like a mixed breed dog   Abstraction: The Plan
 Generics Traits As Interfaces For Code Resuse For Perator Overloading Trait Objects   Traits are rusts interfaces.</description>
