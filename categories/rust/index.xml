      <description>It started with Muxed. I was excited to get a working first build, but despite my development machine being a MacBook Air, I develop most in VM&amp;rsquo;s using vagrant. My native builds were all linux based. It would be easy enough to move the code to an OSX machine and compile there but I do not like build tools on my native machine. And that would simply be too easy.</description>
