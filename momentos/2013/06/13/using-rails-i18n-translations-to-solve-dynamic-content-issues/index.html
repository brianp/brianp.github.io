<p>Last week during my main work contract I had been tasked with doing some
would-be trivial content updates to a section of a client application.
Content updates would normally involve hopping into a view changing some
images or text and re-deploying. This particular section though is a
little more complex then that and way more complex then it should be.</p>

<h3 id="the-setup">The Setup</h3>

<p>This particular section of the application has rotating content. Each
rotation we&rsquo;ll refer to as a <em>Phase</em>. Each phase is displayed for a
length of time determined by the client and is switched on demand via an
admin interface. Some structural changes occur on pages but very few. For the
most part it&rsquo;s copy that changes. On some pages it could be entire
blocks of copy on others maybe simple date changes.<br />
The phases represent stages of a competition. ex:</p>

<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Contest closed - References last years contest.</li>
<li>Phase 2: Announcing the call for submissions opening date and rules.</li>
<li>Phase 3: Call for submissions opened.</li>
<li>Phase 4: Submissions closed. Public judging occurs.</li>
<li>Phase 5: Public Judging closes. Internal judging occurs.</li>
<li>Phase 6: Winners Announced.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>How to offer phase specific copy with out gratuitous amounts of switch or
else/if logic in views. As well as keeping the copy and app as DRY as possible.</p>

<h3 id="failed-attempts">Failed Attempts</h3>

<p>The original implemntation setup was to use partials. Have one partial
with the standard set of copy and then have phase specific partials
that would be included if a phase specific file exists. This was simple.
Everyone knows how partials work and the swtiching system was easy
enough to see and figure out.</p>

<p>The drawbacks weren&rsquo;t apparent at first. Over time as the client
required more and more minute details the partials became more
difficult to manage. Some became less DRY as larger blocks of copy would
have to be repeated with small differenes such as dates or names. Over time
the similar content would get out of sync as someone would make a change
in one phase specific file but not realize the same change was
required in an earlier or later phase specific file. We ended up having
numbered phase folders phase1 - phase6 all with similar files
inside. All of which needed to be changed when layout or copy updates
occured.</p>

<p>This became an un-mangable system. Something will always be missed. Copy
will always be wrong somewhere in any given phase at some point in
time.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-i18n">Introduction to I18n</h3>

<p>Within the same section of application a few months back the client
requested certain pages have internationalized content. Rails makes this
very easy with the inclusion of the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html">I18n gem</a>.
Following a simple structure to manage each pages copy we created a single folder for
each page and placed each language file within the folder:</p>

<p><img src='http://alwayscoding.ca/images/posts/2013-06-10-directory.png' alt='the directory
structure for the internationaliztion files' /></p>

<p>This worked simple enough and meant a handful of pages in this section
of the app are now using I18n helpers and had copy stored in the
YAML files.</p>

<p>Copy stored in YAML translates into a basic key value store.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">en:
  awards:
    program:
      title: The title to the Awards Program page
</code></pre>

<p>With that in our translation files the copy now becomes accessbile
using the I18n interface.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">I18n.t('awards.program.title')
=&gt; &quot;The title to the Awards Program page&quot;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="a-new-idea">A new Idea</h3>

<p>After fighting with phase specific files and more copy issues I
decided we needed to revisit the problem. I began thinking about the
process of internationalizing the previous pages. The usage for I18n
solves almost the exact problem we&rsquo;re having: Same page, different
copy.</p>

<p>I decided to try something simple. Add the content in the yaml,
follow it with the phase specific content and offer it a naming
convention to match the yaml key + phase. Something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">awards:
  marquee:
    pane1:
      title: Audience Voting
      title_p5: Voting now closed
      text: An AUDIENCE AWARD...
</code></pre>

<p>I then added a helper method for views:
<em>note</em>: The <code>@phase</code> variable is being set in a before filter within
this section of the app.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def pt(string)
  phase_string = &quot;#{string}_p#{@phase}&quot;
  I18n.t(phase_string, :default =&gt; string.to_sym)
end
</code></pre>

<p>What this does:
Appends the provided key with the phase number (Lets
assume 5.) Then checks to see if that key is set. If the key is not set use the
original key to find the default return value. Based on our YAML file above
we can now call the method with <code>pt('awards.marquee.pane1.title')</code>. If
the phase happens to be set to 5 our return value will be <code>&quot;Voting now
closed&quot;</code> otherwise we will get <code>&quot;Audience Voting&quot;</code>. YAY! It worked.</p>

<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t sit right though. I left the code as is for the rest of
the day and thought about how it would be used and where it could be
problematic.</p>

<h3 id="let-it-stew">Let it stew</h3>

<p>The next day I came back to the problem having identified a few
situations where the format of the YAML file just wouldn&rsquo;t hold up.</p>

<p>1) What if every field in pane1 needs to be changed per phase. That will
quickly create a chaotic yaml file. title_p1, title_p2, title_p3, etc.</p>

<p>2) What if phase 5 and phase 6 are identical. Now I have to make duplicate
entries for title_p5 and title_p6. That&rsquo;s not very DRY.</p>

<p>The solution needs to be more flexible I thought. I&rsquo;m on the right track
but it should be easier and obvious to manage the content.</p>

<p>Lets look at the YAML for the second problem above:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">awards:
  index:
    module4:
      tab1:
        title: Awards
        header: Awards Contest
        text: The Ad...
        title_p5: Voting Now Closed
        header_p5: Awards Finalists
        text_p5: Winners to be...
        title_p6: Voting Now Closed
        header_p6: Awards Finalists
        text_p6: Winners to be...

# At best we could DRY it up a little by using YAML anchors (&amp;) and references (*)
    ...
        title_p5: &amp;voting_closed Voting Now Closed
        header_p5: &amp;voting_closed_header Awards Finalists
        text_p5: &amp;voting_closed_text Winners to be...
        title_p6: *voting_closed
        header_p6: *voting_closed_header
        text_p6: *voting_closed_text
</code></pre>

<p>We managed to DRY it up a little but it&rsquo;s still hideous. I&rsquo;d have to
define every single phase specific key even if it&rsquo;s the same content.<br />
I don&rsquo;t want to do that. That is the existing problem but
shuffled to a different spot in the app.</p>

<p>I thought about it some more.</p>

<p>What if I could define a phase specific &ldquo;tab1&rdquo; in the yaml. I&rsquo;d still have
to express each phase but the nesting would allow me to DRY it up pretty
quick.</p>

<p>At some point I also decided prepending the phase was better then appending.</p>

<p>I redefined the YAML file in a manner I&rsquo;d <i>like</i> to be able to
manage my content:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">awards:
  index:
    module4:
      tab1:
        title: Awards
        p2_title: Phase 2 title
        header: Awards Contest
        text: The Ad...
      p5_tab1: &amp;voting_closed
        title: Voting Now Closed
        header: Awards Finalists
        text: Winners to be...
      p6_tab1: *voting_closed
</code></pre>

<p>This idea was going to let me create phase specific content at any
nesting level. If I only needed a title change in phase 2. Then simply create a
phase specific title. If I needed a phase specific area. Define the
phase the key a level higher and anything nested will be considered copy for that
area. As shown this also makes replicating entire sections for multiple
phases a breeze using YAML anchors.</p>

<p>It sounded like a solid interface for managing the content but now I
need to make it work. This requires checking for phase specific content
at any given level of the YAML nesting interface. At the beginning at the end
and anywhere in between.</p>

<p>I knew right away I wasn&rsquo;t going to be writing this in a helper method
so I created a new class and utilized the class from within the helper:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def pt(string)
  p = Awards::PhaseTranslations.new(string, @phase)
  p.translate
end
</code></pre>

<p>I started the class off pretty simple. Just replicating the usage I
already had. This worked with the original YAML files but clearly
wouldn&rsquo;t work with the new format.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Awards::PhaseTranslations

  attr_accessor :string, :phase

  def initialize(string, phase)
    @string = string
    @phase = phase
  end

  def find_translation(phrase = nil)
    phase_string = &quot;#{string}_p#{@phase}&quot;
    I18n.t(phase_string, :default =&gt; string.to_sym)
  end

  def translate
    find_translation
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In order to find phase specific keys anywhere within the nesting, the next
thing I had to do was find all possible key combinations.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">string = 'awards.index.module4.tab1.title'
a = string.split('.')
possibilities = a.each_with_index.map do |v,i|
  b = a.clone
  b[i] = &quot;p#{phase}_#{v}&quot;
  b.join('.')
end
=&gt; [&quot;p6_awards.index.module4.tab1.title&quot;,
    &quot;awards.p6_index.module4.tab1.title&quot;,
    &quot;awards.index.p6_module4.tab1.title&quot;,
    &quot;awards.index.module4.p6_tab1.title&quot;,
    &quot;awards.index.module4.tab1.p6_title&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>Great. Next we need to check to see if any of those keys return a value.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def find_translation(phrase = '')
  possibilities.each do |key|
    phrase = I18n.t(key, :default =&gt; '')
    break unless phrase.blank?
  end

  if phrase.blank?
    phrase = I18n.t(string, :default =&gt; '')
  end

  phrase
end
</code></pre>

<p>This checks to see if the keys return anything. If not returning a
default blank string. If <code>phrase</code> is still blank after we have checked all
the keys go back to using the unmodified provided key and return
the phrase. We can&rsquo;t just use the original string as the default anymore
as the first key miss would then set the <code>phrase</code> to the original key
value and we would short-circuit the loop.</p>

<p>This also worked pretty well but I quickly realized it to was
problematic. If we actually wanted to pass an empty string as phase
specific content (blanking out a header?) then we would actually end up
with the default header. With the following YAML as an example.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">awards:
  title: Awards Header
  p2_title: ''
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pt('awards.title') # With phase 2
=&gt; 'Awards Header'
</code></pre>

<p>This happens becuase we&rsquo;re comparing against blank values and
considering a blank value a miss. When in this case a blank value is
exactly what we want returned.</p>

<p>To fix the problem we stop setting blank values on the initial lookup.
Lets allow I18n to raise a missing translation exception as that is it&rsquo;s
normal behaviour without defaults.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def find_translation(phrase = nil)
  extract_possibilities.each do |key|
    begin
      phrase = I18n.t(key, :raise =&gt; true)
      break unless phrase.blank?
    rescue
      # Let I18n raise a MissingTranslation exception.
      # We'll blank out the value or find the default after.
    end
  end

  if phrase.nil?
    phrase = I18n.t(string, :default =&gt; '')
  end

  phrase
end
</code></pre>

<p>This solves our blank title issue. As shown below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pt('awards.title') # With phase 2
=&gt; ''
</code></pre>

<h3 id="wrapping-it-all-up">Wrapping it all up</h3>

<p>That pretty much gives us all the functionality we need at the moment.
Check out the full class:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Awards::PhaseTranslations

  attr_accessor :string, :phase, :possibilities

  def initialize(string, phase)
    @string = string
    @phase = phase
  end

  def extract_possibilities
    a = string.split('.')
    self.possibilities = a.each_with_index.map do |v,i|
      b = a.clone
      b[i] = &quot;p#{phase}_#{v}&quot;
      b.join('.')
    end
  end

  def find_translation(phrase = nil)
    extract_possibilities.each do |key|
      begin
        phrase = I18n.t(key, :raise =&gt; true)
        break unless phrase.blank?
      rescue
        # Let I18n raise a MissingTranslation exception.
        # We'll blank out the value or find the default after.
      end
    end

    if phrase.nil?
      phrase = I18n.t(string, :default =&gt; '')
    end

    phrase
  end

  def translate
    find_translation
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>After using translations in this way for a few days the new method
proved its versatility. Allowing the formatting of the YAML
files in different but very declarative manners. Just to start:</p>

<p>All in all I found the new soltion to be quickly solving all the copy
update issues we were previously encountering. As we move the content
into the translation files slowly we can be removing all the repetitive
phase specific view files that have cluttered up the view directories.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading through the post. The code is far from perfect but I
felt like I wanted to share the process anyway. If you have any
suggestions or corrections to make please send me an email
or find me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/brian_pearce">twitter</a>.</p>

I was excited to get a working first build, but despite my development machine being a MacBook Air, I develop most in VM&rsquo;s using vagrant. My native builds were all linux based. It would be easy enough to move the code to an OSX machine and compile there but I do not like build tools on my native machine. And that would simply be too easy.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I started writing an Angular application to intereact with an API I have produced recently. The Angular app is compiled as a static site with Jekyll. I immediately ran into an issue with Angular. None of my expressions were showing up. I realized it was because Liquid which is included with Jekyll uses the same expression tags as Angular: {{ myVariable }}. This meant the Angular expressions were not making it as raw text into the final template as they were being caught by Liquid.</div>
