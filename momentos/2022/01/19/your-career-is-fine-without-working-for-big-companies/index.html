              <p>I&rsquo;ve thought about this numerous times over the course of my career and it is
something I want to share. This is for the junior and intermediate developers
out there who spend time visiting conferences, reading blogs, listening to
podcasts, and doing their best to hone their craft. The developers who week
after week take in content from industry influencers talking about the big projects
they&rsquo;ve worked on at <em>BigCompany</em>. Maybe you have thought about what it would
feel like to work on similar big projects and experience growth in the industry
like them.</p>
<p>I want to let you know－ it is okay if you never work for a big company. You
do not need a Facebook, Google, or Netflix on your resume to have a well rounded
and fulfilling career. There are lots of smaller companies with rooms full of
great talent and experienced people to learn from. They may not be broadcasting
it as loudly as some but they are there and they are working on interesting
problems.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that people in the spotlight, on stage at
conferences, and being interviewed on podcasts, give intriguing glimpses into what
they do but these glimpses are refined, heavily finessed, <em>highlight reels</em> of
reality. A sub section of the work they do. What you don&rsquo;t
see is all the same work <em>you</em> do every day. Fixing mundane bugs, sitting in
planning meetings, writing more CRUD operations, getting stuck on something and
finding the answers on stackoverflow. Their job is probably not spending all day every day on
that one interesting presentation you watched.</p>
<p>A resume full of companies no one else would recognize can still be an accomplished
career. Do not let the noise on social media give you FOMO. If you are happy
with your work life balance, and you get along with the people you work with you&rsquo;re most likely
not missing out on anything. Take a little more pride in your projects and
feel a greater sense of fulfillment. You may just make someone else think &ldquo;I want to do what that person
is doing&rdquo;.</p>
