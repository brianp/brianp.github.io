  <p>I&rsquo;m in no way partnered with any brands mentioned nor are any of the links
referrals. They&rsquo;re simply links to products I used.</p>
</div>
<p>We had our first child five months ago. A beautiful little boy- Remi. We&rsquo;re lucky
enough to have good friends around us who have also recently had children and we
received lots of baby clothes, toys, and items donated or on loan.</p>
<p>This post is written not with any advice in mind, but around some of the
reptitive tasks we do daily and items we found useful each day.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive right in.</p>
<h3 id="full-body-onesies">Full body Onesies</h3>
<p>A cute multi-piece outfit is great for pictures, but when you’re tired and on
your nth diaper change of the day you don’t want to deal with multiple clothing
items. Taking the pants off, undoing the tuck flap button. Maybe removing a sweater.
Most days a full body onesie will save you time and effort.</p>
<h3 id="socks--shoes">Socks &amp; Shoes</h3>
<p>Useless*<br>
They end up kicked off within minutes. We own only a few pairs
and I’ve put them on him maybe three times in these five months. They&rsquo;re cute,
and again make for great photos, but usually impractical.</p>
<p>As part of the full body onesies ensure they have footies or attached booties.
This goes for pants as well. Of all the pants we have I mainly use the ones with
footies attached because I never put socks on him.</p>
<p>

 
  
  
  
  
    
  
    
      
    
  

<div class="figure fig-50" >

</div>

*The exception to the rule: This single pair of hand knit socks made by a
friends mother for their baby. They were handed down to us as their children
had grown out of them. The combination of high sock and being able to tie it
around the ankle give them a much higher chance of staying on longer.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<h3 id="wash-cloths">Wash cloths</h3>
<p>Just have lots.<br>
Remi suffered from reflux so he may have spit up more then normal in the
beginning. Every morning I had to put three to four wash cloths in the living
room to clean up
spit up and drool. Most days all the wash cloths will be soiled by bedtime.
They don’t need to be decorative or fancy you just need them in quantity. He
does have a preference for softer clothes when wiping his face though 😄.</p>
<h3 id="reusable-baby-wipes">Reusable Baby Wipes</h3>
<p>If you like to be more eco friendly I highly recommend
<a href="https://www.cheekywipes.com/all-reusable-baby-wipes-kits/baby-wipes-kit.html">these</a> reusable baby
wipes. It comes with two boxes that you keep water in. A clean box and
mucky box. The package also comes with essential oils. A few drops in the clean
box for a fresh smell. A few drops in the dirty box to cover up the smell, as
well as to begin breaking down the spoil.</p>
<p>I found I had to use 2-3 disposable wipes every cleanup. These reusable wipes clean
more effieciently. I can use a single wipe per diaper change. Then just toss it
in the “mucky” box, and about every two days we wash everything in the mucky
box. At this point because he&rsquo;s not eating solids infant stool is water soluble
and can be thrown directly into the washing machine. After the wash the wipes
are still completely white. It&rsquo;s worth noting that when we
washed them at 40°c they left a little staining. When washed at 60°c even the
previously stained ones came out perfectly clean.</p>
<h3 id="cloth-diapers">Cloth Diapers</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of variation in the realm of cloth diapers. All-in-ones, inserts
types of inserts, bamboo, hemp, microfibre, cotton. Different babies of course
have different needs and which type you need will vary. We spent our first two
days trying cloth diapers without success. We had to change his onesies with
every diaper because he had peed completely through them. It was time to do some
tests. We had bought everything second hand and had a mixture of cotton, hemp,
and microfible inserts at different sizes, with a couple differently sized diapers.
We tried each liner in each diaper and ran them under the tap. We realized that
the cotton liners held water fine but they absorbed far to slow, causing the
water to runoff the side of the diaper and leaking. The microfibre and
hemp liners absorbed initial flows much faster and we decided they were
preferable to the cotton liners.</p>
<h5 id="how-long-they-last">How long they last</h5>
<p>Then comes duration of use. If a normal diaper
lasted 2-3 hours, a cloth diaper laster 1.5-2. They just don&rsquo;t hold as much.
Which means you have the new task of keeping track of how long they have been
wearing that particular diaper. On the other hand more changes isn&rsquo;t really a
problem because they&rsquo;re mostly waste free! Once he started approaching 3.5
months we started double-lining the diapers. One microfibre closer to the body,
and a cotton layer behind it. This helped extend the usage per diaper by about
an hour.</p>
<h5 id="when-to-use">When to use</h5>
<p>We don&rsquo;t use them all the time. I think they&rsquo;re great and we like using them.
It&rsquo;s less waste in the bin, and babies get use to a &ldquo;wet&rdquo; sensation which
supposidly helps them recognize peeing habits down the road when it comes to
potty training. We still don&rsquo;t use them all the time though. I don&rsquo;t want to
deal with carrying a bag of soiled cloth diapers around outside. If we&rsquo;re going
out and we know we&rsquo;ll be out for more then a couple hours we will use a
disposable diaper. If we change him while we&rsquo;re out we can toss it in any bin.
We also don&rsquo;t use them overnight. As I said the duration for them is 1.5-2 (now
2.5) hours. He can&rsquo;t sleep through a night and not end up peeing through his
pjs.</p>
<h5 id="diaper-liners">Diaper Liners</h5>
<p>

</div>

They&rsquo;re like a biodegradable single
piece of papertowel. You put them between baby and the diaper. This essentially
catches the majority of the spoilage and when you&rsquo;re removing the diaper you can
remove this single sheet and drop it straight in the bin. Leaving the reusable
diaper in a much cleaner state for machine washing. It is one more peice of
waste but I take comfort knowing it&rsquo;s biodegradable and a single sheet is still
less waste then a single diaper.</p>
<p>Although we bought them early, we didn’t start using them until about 1.5 months
because infants are just to small for them, and the extra effort in those early
weeks is just not something you need to be focused on.</p>
<h5 id="cloth-diapers-in-brief">Cloth diapers in brief:</h5>
<ul>
<li>We still use disposable diapers when we take him out for a long time.</li>
<li>We still use disposable diapers when we put him to bed at night.</li>
<li>We like microfibre and hemp inserts.</li>
<li>We’re down to 1 disposable a day, and 5-8 reusables a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is more to think about and do but to me it’s an excellent trade off. Both for
saving money, and preventing environmental waste.</p>
<h3 id="diaper-caddie">Diaper Caddie</h3>
<p>

 
  
  
  
  
    
  
    
      
    
  

<div class="figure fig-50" >
  
    <a class="fancybox" href="https://alwayscoding.ca/images/posts/2022-02-07-03.jpg" title="Our mobile diaper caddie" data-fancybox="">

    </a>
  
   
    <span class="caption">Our mobile diaper caddie</span>
  
</div>

We don’t have a changing table. We have a portable changing station.
Why have a table that you always need to go too. In the middle of the night I
don’t want to wake up and take him to another room. Or to be in the playing with
him in living room and have to go somewhere to change him. We bought a mat, and
a caddie. The caddie contains creams, disposable diapers, the reusable wipe
boxes, a garbage bag for waste, and usually a stack of 1-4 reusable diapers.
This allows us to have it wherever we are in the home. It’s in our room at night
for quick sleepy diaper changes. It’s in the living room during the day where
he’s playing. It’s wherever we want it to be, instead of the need to go anywhere
else. This was our primary diaper changing situation until about four and half
months. All of a sudden his diaper changing needs often aligned with his nap
cycles so it became practical to change him at his crib, which conveniently had
a diaper change addon built in.</p>
<h3 id="bath-support">Bath Support</h3>
<p>

 
  
  
  
  
    
  
    
      
    
  

<div class="figure fig-100" >
  
    <a class="fancybox" href="https://alwayscoding.ca/images/posts/2022-02-07-04.jpg" title="Baby bath in the sink" data-fancybox="">
  
    <img class="fig-img" src="https://alwayscoding.ca/images/posts/2022-02-07-04.jpg"  alt="Baby bath in the sink">

    <span class="caption">Baby bath in the sink</span>
  
</div>

I knew we would end up getting a baby bath but I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a support. The
support clips to the edge of the bath and Remi sits comfortably in the water. It
keeps his head safely out of the water during bath time. He can still splash and
kick around, and we can be a little more worry free. 🎶Little baby spa time🎶</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. We use these things every day and a few simple variations makes
dealing with them easier and the three of us happier.</p>
