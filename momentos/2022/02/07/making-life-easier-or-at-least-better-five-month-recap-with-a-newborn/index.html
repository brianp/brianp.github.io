<p>I&rsquo;m adamantly against giving advice about parenting. That&rsquo;s why this post does
not tell you what you should or should not be doing. It&rsquo;s about things we&rsquo;ve
done that have worked well for us. Specifically it&rsquo;s written around the lessons
learned around from we use regularly.</p>
<p>We had our first child five months ago. I beautiful little boy- Remi. We&rsquo;re lucky
enough to have good friends around us who have also recently had children and we
received lots of baby clothes, toys, and items donated or on loan.</p>
<h3 id="full-body-onesies">Full body Onesies</h3>
<p>A cute multi-piece outfit is great for pictures, but when you’re tired and on
your nth diaper change of the day you don’t want to deal with multiple clothing
items. Taking the pants off, undoing the onesie-shirt. Maybe removing a sweater.
Most days a full body onesie will save you time and effort.</p>
<h3 id="socks--shoes">Socks &amp; Shoes</h3>
<p>Useless. They end up kicked off within minutes. We own maybe only a few pairs
and I’ve put them on him maybe three times in these five months.</p>
<p>As part of the full body onesies ensure they have footies or attached booties.
This goes for pants as well. Of all the pants we have I mainly use the ones with
footies attached because I never put socks on him.</p>
<h3 id="wash-clothes">Wash clothes</h3>
<p>Just have lots.
Remi suffered from reflux so he may have spit up more then normal in the
beginning. Every morning I had to put three to four wash clothes in the living
room to clean up
spit up and drool. Most days all the wash clothes will be soiled by bedtime.
They don’t need to be decorative or fancy you just need them in quantity. He
does have a preference for softer clothes when wiping his face though 😄.
Remi suffered from reflux so he may have spit up more than other babies but it’s
probably still good for</p>
<h3 id="reusable-baby-wipes">Reusable Baby Wipes</h3>
<p>If you like to be more eco friendly I highly recommend these reusable baby
wipes. It comes with two boxes that you keep scented water in.
I found I had to use 2-3 disposable wipes every poop. These wipes clean
better, I can use a single wipe, toss it in the “mucky” box, and about
every two days we wash all the dirty ones, and put them back in the clean
box. At this point because infant stool is water soluble the wipes are
still completely white.</p>
<p>We do- with mixed results.
We bought them all second hand, (actually we buy most his onsies second hand too. 10€ for bundles of 8+ etc). There’s lots of variations of cloth diapers. All-in-ones, insert ones, microfibre inserts, cotton inserts.
Surprisingly the design of the single all-in-one we have seems to hold the most pee/poop without leakage but it takes FOREVER to dry compared to the others.
The first handful of times we tried them he leaked through them almost instantly. So we ran some tests :smile:
We found cotton inserts don’t absorb quick enough for him. He pee’s, it tries to absorb but there’s always run-off, and he leaks.
The microfibre inserts handle everything much better. Right now we do both. A microfibre insert closer to him, and a cotton insert to try and absorb access behind it.
We also use a special “sheet” like a papertowl almost, placed directly inside the diaper. So there’s still a bit of waste but its less than a whole diaper. This sheet is then quickly discarded during changing and it contains most the stool.
Cloth diapers don’t last as long (per-usage) overall. Disposable diapers last 2-3 hours, the cloth diapers last 1.5-2. With a very thin margin for error. So there’s an adjustment you need to make mentally to avoid them pee’ing through the clothes. That said- I find it worth it. We wash the diapers every night with the rest of his stuff and none of them look soiled at all.
I literally just received a box of extra microfibre liners while writing this :smile:
We still use disposable diapers when we take him out because we don’t want the hassle of “storing” the cloth diapers in the stroller etc.
We still use disposable diapers when we put him to bed at night because it’s a 6hr+ stretch before we change him again (at this point). So there’s no way the cloth ones will make it through the night.
So we’re down to 1 disposable a day, and 6-8 re-usables a day. And to me that’s an excellent trade off. Both for saving money, and environment. It is more to think about though, and more hassle. Big caveat: although we bought them early, we didn’t start using them until about 1.5-2 months because infants are just to small for them, and the extra effort in those early weeks will drain you. (edited)</p>
<p>This now reminds me. Another thing we like. We don’t have a changing table. We have a portable changing station.
Why have a table that you always need to go too. I don’t want to wake up and take him to another room. Or to be in the living room, and have to go somewhere to change him. We bought a mat, and a caddie. The caddie contains creams, disposable diapers, the re-usable wipe boxes, a garbage bag for waste, and usually a stack of 1-2 re-usable diapers (not pictured).
This allows us to have it wherever we are in the home. It’s in our room at night for quick sleepy diaper changes. It’s in the living room during the day where he’s playing etc. It’s wherever we want it to be, instead of having to go somewhere else.</p>
