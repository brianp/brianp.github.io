      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in no way partnered with any brands mentioned nor are any of the links referrals. They&amp;rsquo;re simply links to products I used.
 We had our first child five months ago. A beautiful little boy- Remi. We&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have good friends around us who have also recently had children and we received lots of baby clothes, toys, and items donated or on loan.
This post is written not with any advice in mind, but around some of the repetitive tasks we do daily and items we found useful each day.</description>
