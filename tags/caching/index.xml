      <description>One of the much larger Rails applications I work on makes heavy use of caching for obvious reasons. In some locations the cache isn&amp;rsquo;t auto-expiring at the moment. After doing a deployment I needed to expire these sections manually via the console for my first time. I grabbed the name of the fragment from the view where it was being cached.
- cache(&amp;#39;all_category_judges&amp;#39;) do ... I only knew one way to access the cache in the console and attempted clearing the cache fragment from there.</description>
