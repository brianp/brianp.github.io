      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about this numerous times over the course of my career and it is something I want to share. This is for the junior and intermediate developers out there who spend time visiting conferences, reading blogs, listening to podcasts, and doing their best to hone their craft. The developers who week after week take in content from industry influencers talking about the big projects they&amp;rsquo;ve worked on at BigCompany. Maybe you have thought about what it would feel like to work on similar big projects and experience growth in the industry like them.</description>
