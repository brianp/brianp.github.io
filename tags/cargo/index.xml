      <description>This week I decided that my Pocket to Buffer via IFTTT setup wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it anymore. Predominantly because I use a trial account of buffer and I can only queue ten items at a time. The developer in me screamed &amp;ldquo;you can build it yourself.&amp;rdquo; Although normally I would lean away from the idea I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time to write Rust lately and decided it would be nice to throw together a few crates and get the job done.</description>
