      <description>I started writing an Angular application to intereact with an API I have produced recently. The Angular app is compiled as a static site with Jekyll. I immediately ran into an issue with Angular. None of my expressions were showing up. I realized it was because Liquid which is included with Jekyll uses the same expression tags as Angular: {{ myVariable }}. This meant the Angular expressions were not making it as raw text into the final template as they were being caught by Liquid.</description>
