      <description>In the apps I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on recently I decided to utilize rails built in authentication &amp;lsquo;has_secure_password&amp;rsquo; which began shipping with Rails 3.1.

When trying to use the has_secure_password method I got:
undefined local variable or method `has_secure_password&amp;#39; for User:Class (NameError) Solution: You must include include ActiveModel::SecurePassword.</description>
