      <description>I get this terminal error about every three to six months:
error: gpg failed to sign the data fatal: failed to write commit object When I see it I think &amp;ldquo;I really should have written down the problem last time&amp;rdquo;. So here we are, ready and willing to document.

And that would simply be too easy.</description>
