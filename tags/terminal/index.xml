      <description>I was running some commands that I later found out had left me with many orphaned ruby processes. Too many to kill one by one. I needed to just get rid of them all and quickly so killing all ruby processes was the best way to go.
Here is a short list of convenient and inconvenient ways to do that:
for each in `ps -eo pid,command | grep ruby | grep -v grep | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39; `; do kill -9 $each;done killall −9 ruby pkill -9 ruby pidof ruby | xargs kill -9 ps aux | grep sidekiq | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39; | xargs kill  The easiest commands and best suggestions were brought to my attention by Alan Bailward and Gavin Mogan.</description>
